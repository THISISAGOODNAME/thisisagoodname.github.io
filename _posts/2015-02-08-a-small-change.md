I made a small change in the gh-pages branch, add google analytics script.

The main <q>JS</q> script was in the <q>_include</q> folder, and  this JS file was included in <q>head.html</q>.

In <q>_config.yml</q> file, I add the Google analytics key.

To fork the version with google analytics, please try this command:

<code>git clone --branch gh-pages https://github.com/yulijia/freshman21.git</code>

### Attention: Only gh-pages branch has google analytics and this article.
